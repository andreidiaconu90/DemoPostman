# Postman + Newman  = <3

This repo has been using during the Postman + Newman = <3 talk, in which showcases i talked about using Postman as a tool for writing E2E/integration tests, how to get the most out of them(using variables, scripts, test cases), and how they integrate in a CI/CD pipeline. The talk also includes practical examples of how to integrate postman tests into a project as well as live coding demos.
